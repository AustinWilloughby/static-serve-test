  <h1>Static Serve Test</h1>
  <p>There should be two test images below.</p>
  
  <!--Below are two image tags. When the browser loads the image tag, it makes
  a request to a server for the image. If a full url is specified, it will make a
  request to the proper server for that resource. If you have a relative path, like
  below, it will make a request back to the server that sent the html page. In this
  case, it is making a request back to our server for /test1.jpg and /test2.jpg.
  
  Because we have our serve-static system set up, these files will be sent back and will
  automatically display.-->
  <img src="/test1.jpg" />
  <img src="/test2.jpg" />
